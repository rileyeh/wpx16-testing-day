# Testing 

## Unit Tests
- run new npx create-react-app and then make a __tests__ folder in the src folder, move the App.test.js file into this folder. We really don't have to do this, but when you have lots of test files, it's nice to have them in one folder isntead of sprinkled throughout your app.
- let's look at this file and see what it's doing. Well, it's just looking to see if the Learn React link is in the App.js file. 
- let's add a similar, simpler test, what if we just wanted to see if the component was rendering? 
- now let's change up our App component and then we will add to our tests

## e2e Tests
- let's start by installing cypress using  'npm i --save-dev cypress"
